# qstp - image recognition 

# This is a deep learning model built on FashionMNIST dataset. It consist of 3 convolutional layers, 2 Max Pooling layers and 1 fully connected layer with xavier initialisation and batch normalisation. It has ReLU as an activation function and adagrad as an optimizer

# I have chosen these configurations for my model as these were giving maximum accuracy and minimum loss in minimum no of iterations
